# Bullet/List Functionality Test Results

## Changes Made:

1. **Made bullet/list buttons visible when text element is selected**
   - Removed the condition that only showed buttons when `isEditingText` was true
   - Now buttons appear whenever a text element is selected (not shapes)

2. **Enhanced button functionality**
   - Buttons now work in two modes:
     - If not editing: Start editing mode and apply formatting
     - If already editing: Apply formatting directly
   - Added `disabled` state for buttons when no text element is selected

3. **Improved formatText function**
   - Better handling of multiple line selections
   - Prevents duplicate bullets/numbers on lines that already have them
   - Proper indentation support for multi-line selections
   - More robust cursor position management

4. **Added visual feedback for formatted text**
   - Modified the display rendering to show proper spacing for bullets and numbered lists
   - Handles indentation visually with padding
   - Uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render formatted content properly

## Expected Behavior:

1. Select any text element (not shapes) → Bullet/list buttons appear in toolbar
2. Click bullet button → Text gets bullet points added
3. Click numbered list button → Text gets numbered list formatting
4. Indent/Outdent buttons work for adjusting list indentation
5. Visual feedback shows bullets and indentation properly in the rendered text

## Testing Instructions:

1. Open the presentation editor at http://localhost:3002/presentation-editor
2. Click on a text element to select it
3. Verify bullet/list buttons are visible in the toolbar
4. Click the bullet button and verify text gets formatted
5. Try selecting multiple lines and applying bullets
6. Test numbered lists, indent, and outdent functionality
