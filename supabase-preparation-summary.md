# Supabase Preparation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Data Consistency Audit
- Created comprehensive audit document identifying all data model issues
- Found missing fields, inconsistent types, and structural problems
- Documented recommendations for each data model

### 2. Database Types Definition
- Created `/types/database.ts` with complete type definitions
- Added all necessary fields for Supabase integration
- Included proper relationships and foreign keys
- Added soft delete support with `deletedAt` fields

### 3. Data Mappers
- Created `/lib/database-mappers.ts` for type conversions
- Added validation functions for database types
- Created utilities to normalize inconsistent data

### 4. Mock Data Standardization
- Created `/lib/mock-data.ts` with consistent mock data
- Fixed ID format inconsistencies (using string IDs)
- Standardized date formats (ISO 8601)
- Normalized status and category values
- Added helper functions for data access

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. User Model
- ✅ Added missing `id` field
- ✅ Added `createdAt`, `updatedAt` timestamps
- ✅ Made `tier` required with default value
- ✅ Added `role` field for permissions
- ✅ Split name into `firstName` and `lastName`

### 2. Presentation Model
- ✅ Added proper ID and ownership fields
- ✅ Standardized status values to enum
- ✅ Added sharing/collaboration fields
- ✅ Added proper timestamps
- ✅ Fixed category inconsistencies

### 3. Data Inconsistencies
- ✅ Standardized date formats to ISO 8601
- ✅ Changed all IDs from numbers to strings
- ✅ Fixed status value inconsistencies
- ✅ Normalized field names (slideCount vs slides)

## Remaining Tasks Before Supabase Integration

### 1. Update Components
- [ ] Update dashboard to use new mock data structure
- [ ] Update templates page to use standardized data
- [ ] Update presentation editor to save with new structure
- [ ] Add proper error handling for database operations

### 2. Add Validation
- [ ] Install Zod for runtime validation
- [ ] Create validation schemas for all database types
- [ ] Add input validation to forms

### 3. Create Database Utilities
- [ ] Add UUID generation utility
- [ ] Create database error handling utilities
- [ ] Add retry logic for database operations
- [ ] Create connection pooling strategy

### 4. Prepare Migration Strategy
- [ ] Create SQL schema based on database types
- [ ] Define indexes for common queries
- [ ] Create Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Plan data migration from mock to real data

### 5. Authentication Preparation
- [ ] Plan Supabase Auth integration
- [ ] Update User type to include auth fields
- [ ] Create auth context and hooks
- [ ] Plan session management

## Database Schema Overview

### Tables Needed:
1. `users` - User accounts
2. `user_settings` - User preferences
3. `presentations` - Presentation metadata
4. `slides` - Individual slides
5. `slide_elements` - Elements within slides
6. `templates` - Presentation templates
7. `plans` - Subscription plans
8. `subscriptions` - User subscriptions
9. `usage_metrics` - Usage tracking
10. `chat_sessions` - AI chat sessions
11. `chat_messages` - Chat messages
12. `file_assets` - Uploaded files
13. `shares` - Presentation sharing
14. `activity_logs` - Audit trail

### Key Relationships:
- User → Many Presentations
- Presentation → Many Slides
- Slide → Many SlideElements
- User → One Subscription
- Subscription → One Plan
- Presentation → Many ChatSessions
- ChatSession → Many ChatMessages

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install zod uuid
   ```

2. **Update Components** - Start with dashboard and work through each page

3. **Create Supabase Project** - Set up project and get connection details

4. **Generate SQL Schema** - Use database types to create tables

5. **Implement Auth** - Set up Supabase Auth with the app

6. **Migrate Mock Data** - Create seed scripts for development

7. **Add Real-time Features** - Implement collaborative editing

The application is now well-prepared for Supabase integration with consistent data models, proper type definitions, and standardized mock data.
