# Code Issues Report

## Summary
This report documents all bugs, issues, and areas that need refactoring found during the codebase audit.

## 1. Console.log Statements (Should be Removed)

### File: `/app/presentation-editor/page.tsx`
- Line 267: `console.log("Restoring version:", versionId)`
- Line 271: `console.log("Previewing version:", versionId)`

### File: `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Line 552: `console.log("Duplicate feature coming soon!")`
- Line 564: `console.log("Share feature coming soon!")`
- Line 577: `console.log("Delete feature coming soon!")`

### File: `/app/upgrade/page.tsx`
- Line 17: `console.log(`Upgrading to ${planName} plan`)`

### File: `/app/settings/page.tsx`
- Line 45: `console.log("Account deletion request submitted")`

## 2. TODO Comments

### File: `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Line 551: `// TODO: Implement duplicate presentation feature`
- Line 563: `// TODO: Implement share presentation feature`
- Line 576: `// TODO: Implement delete presentation feature`

### File: `/app/presentation-editor/hooks/useSlideDragAndDrop.ts`
- Line 136: `// TODO: Use TIMEOUTS.SLIDE_TRANSITION from app-constants`

### File: `/app/settings/page.tsx`
- Line 44: `// TODO: Replace with proper toast notification`

## 3. TypeScript Type Safety Issues

### Overall Assessment
- No TypeScript compilation errors found
- Types are generally well-defined with interfaces

### Potential Improvements
- Some inline type definitions could be extracted to the `/types` directory
- Mock data types could be better centralized

## 4. Unused Imports

### File: `/app/templates/page.tsx`
- Lines 10-15: Many Lucide icons imported but not used (Star, Clock, TrendingUp, Users, Briefcase, GraduationCap, BarChart, Lightbulb, Target, Heart, Globe, Palette, Megaphone)
- Line 10: `Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger` imported but not used
- Line 19-29: `gradientClasses` object defined but never used
- Line 242: `sortBy` state defined but sorting logic is incomplete

### File: `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Line 23: `Edit` icon imported but not used

## 5. Missing Error Handling

### Critical Areas
- No try-catch blocks in async operations
- No error boundaries implemented
- API calls (when implemented) will need proper error handling
- File operations lack error handling

### Specific Examples
- Presentation save/autosave operations have no failure handling
- User actions (delete, duplicate, share) have no error states
- Theme switching has no fallback for invalid values

## 6. Performance Issues

### Potential Memory Leaks
- `/app/presentation-editor/hooks/useSlideDragAndDrop.ts` Line 61: Cloned drag image might not be removed if component unmounts during drag

### Inefficient Re-renders
- Multiple `setTimeout` calls for auto-save could be optimized with debouncing
- Slide carousel re-renders on every slide change even if not visible

### Large Bundle Size
- All templates are loaded in memory even if not displayed
- Mock data is included in production bundle

## 7. Accessibility Concerns

### Missing ARIA Labels
- Drag and drop functionality lacks screen reader support
- Icon-only buttons missing aria-labels
- Modal dialogs missing proper ARIA attributes

### Keyboard Navigation
- Slide carousel not keyboard accessible
- Drag and drop has no keyboard alternative
- Some interactive elements missing focus indicators

## 8. Code Consistency Issues

### Inconsistent Patterns
- Some components use default exports, others use named exports
- Inconsistent spacing in className strings
- Mixed approaches to handling loading states

### Naming Conventions
- Some files use PascalCase, others use kebab-case
- Inconsistent prop naming (onSomething vs handleSomething)

## 9. Security Concerns

### Potential XSS Vulnerabilities
- Markdown content rendered without sanitization
- User input not validated before display

### Missing Input Validation
- No validation on presentation titles
- No limits on content length
- No file type validation for future uploads

## 10. Missing Features Marked as "Coming Soon"

### Dashboard Features
- Duplicate presentation
- Share presentation  
- Delete presentation

### Settings Features
- Proper toast notifications
- Theme persistence
- Account deletion API

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Remove all console.log statements
   - Fix unused imports
   - Add error boundaries to main layouts

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading and error states
   - Improve accessibility with ARIA labels

3. **Long-term Refactoring**
   - Extract mock data to separate development files
   - Implement proper state management (Context or Redux)
   - Add comprehensive testing
   - Implement proper logging service
   - Add performance monitoring

4. **Before Production**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add rate limiting
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
   - Implement proper CSP headers
